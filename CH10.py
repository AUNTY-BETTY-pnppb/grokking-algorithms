# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS

# the classification of an item depending on it's neighbours
# if an apple is more red than green, then it is a red apple.

# the algorithm is applied in graphs, to find the nearest user use the
# pythagorean formula to see distance between users

# Regression - predicting a response from calculating response of k-nearest neighbours.
# Usually just average out responses.
